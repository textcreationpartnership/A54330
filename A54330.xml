            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Have not been with thee upon this Errand a long time: and perhaps I could coyn as many formal Lyes, and frame as Substantial Excuse for not appearing in Print, as people ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally do on the contrary occasion. But hang't! I scorn to tell a Lye for the matter. The plain down right naked truth on't is, that I, being but a Collector, and (as some say) a spoyler of Songs; Twas impossible (you know) I should Collect or Publish what was not written, and in good faith the Poetastors of the Town, have of late (for what cause I know not) been extraordinary idle, and yet I think, not altogether so idle as they would have been if they had written more. But I'm sure I was like to have had the worst o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

Thus you see what Shifts we poor Collectors are driven to, nor can we in reason complain, when our Authours, the Poets themselves, thrive no better; I know 'em all pretty familiarly, and call 'em <hi>Jack, Tom,</hi> &amp;c. where-ever I meet 'em, and if they are to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, (as they can speak Truth sometimes) the Trade is grown so dull they can hardly live by it, and truely I think one of the Notablest of 'em, has quite given it over. However, as long as there is a New Song to be got for Love or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and that will be as long as there is a Poet, and that will be as long as there is a Town, thou shalt be sure, as often as possible, from thy Old Friend:</p>
